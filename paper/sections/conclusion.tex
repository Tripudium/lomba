\section{Conclusion and next steps}

We presented a continuous-time LOB forecasting architecture that integrates a mixture-of-exponentials TPP head with hierarchical mark decoders on top of a Mamba state-space backbone. The design emphasizes calibrated near-horizon risk estimates and structured mark distributions while remaining computationally efficient for long streams.

Future work will extend the empirical study to multiple assets and regimes, explore robustness under distribution shift, and compare against transformer-based TPP baselines. Additional extensions include richer mark taxonomies (e.g., depth snapshots), adaptive binning under drift, and deployment-oriented latency profiling.
