\section{Evaluation plan}

We report both temporal and mark-centric metrics, emphasizing calibration for trading use-cases.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.25em]
    \item \textbf{Temporal metrics}: negative log-likelihood of $\Delta t$, Brier score for $P(\Delta t \le \tau)$, expected calibration error (ECE), and coverage of calibration bins.
    \item \textbf{Mark metrics}: coarse and residual accuracy/entropy per field; joint mark accuracy; hierarchical perplexity when applicable.
    \item \textbf{Sampling diagnostics}: empirical mean and variance of sampled $\Delta t$; histograms of sampled coarse marks compared to validation frequencies.
\end{itemize}

Experiments will be added after completing broader evaluations across instruments and days. We will focus on (i) ablations over mixture size $K$, binning schemes, and smoothing strengths; (ii) the impact of time-of-day and soft binning; and (iii) robustness to regime shifts (open/close, news events).
